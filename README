Operating system used : Linxu 
Computer original OS: Mac OS

The reason why I installed Linux operating system is because I have got segmentation fault after 
executing “make” in Graphics project.

Here is the following step to setup the OpenGL environment:
    1.I have downloaded VirtualBox and ubuntu disk image in ubuntu.com
    2.Installed Virtual studio Code editor in my virtual Linux
    3.Installed the necessary library files and dependency of OpenGL. 
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install g++
        sudo apt-get install freeglut3
        sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
        sudo apt-get install binutils-gold
        sudo apt-get install g++ cmake
        sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
        sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
        sudo apt-get install build-essential
        sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev libglm-dev
        sudo apt-get install libxml-dev lib-dev

    4.There were some spelling mistakes in include/GL/glew.h
	  Line 1155 and Line 1157. It should be <OpenGL/glut.h> instead of <OpenGL/glu.h>


After following the instruction and make file works.
